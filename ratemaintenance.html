            <ul>
                <li>Shippers can accept only a subset of updated lanes. For example, if 10 lanes are submitted by the carrier, the shipper may accept 5 lanes, rejecting or revising the rest.</li>
                <li>Revised lanes are sent back to the carrier for approval or rejection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Full Amendments:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All updated lanes are accepted simultaneously, finalizing the entire contract.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Shippers can Reject, Accept, or Revise rates based on their requirements. Revising a rate generates a Partial Amendment for further carrier review.</li>

            <h3>Carrier Actions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Carriers can only Accept or Reject counter-offers or amendment requests sent by the shipper.</li>

            <h3>Steps for Bulk Upload</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access the Rate Maintenance Module:</strong> Navigate to RateCube and select Rate Maintenance from the sidebar.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose Template:</strong> Select the required template for the upload from the dropdown menu (e.g., NA, GT Air, or GT Ocean).</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the File:</strong> Populate the Excel or CSV template with the rates to be uploaded, ensuring all required fields are complete.</li>
                <li><strong>Upload the File:</strong> Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button for processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Submit the file for processing.</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Several carriers will be detected even if the shipper uploads one file.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Validate and Review:</strong> Verify and Confirm the Rate Upload summary:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the Rate file uploads successfully, you will receive a message saying that "The files have been uploaded successfully"</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>OFA and RFA Processes in Rate Maintenance</h2>
            <p>The OFA and RFA processes play a critical role in managing rate amendments between carriers and shippers. Below is a detailed guide to these processes, including actions, notifications, and key indicators.</p>
            <img src="img/ofa.png" alt="OFA Process Diagram">
    
            <h3>Offer for Amendment (OFA)</h3>
            <h4>Process Overview:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> A carrier uploads an OFA, and a unique reference number is generated for tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Shipper Notification:</strong> A task is created, and an email notification is sent to the shipper.</li>
                <li><strong>Shipper Actions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Approval:</strong> The shipper can approve the OFA, creating a Full Amendment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Counteroffer:</strong> The shipper can counter the OFA, requesting revised rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Final Steps:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The carrier can accept the counteroffer or upload revised rates based on the shipper's request.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Key Indicators for Actions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Actions taken by shippers are marked with an <strong>S</strong> indicator, while carrier actions are denoted by a <strong>C</strong>.</li>
                <li>Different colors represent various statuses:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Request for Amendment (RFA)</li>
                        <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Offer for Amendment (OFA)</li>
                        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Accepted</li>
                        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Awaiting Approval</li>
                        <li><strong>Red:</strong> Rejected</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Request for Amendment (RFA)</h3>
            <h4>Process Overview:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> The shipper changes rates and sends an RFA to the carrier.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrier Notification:</strong> An email notification is sent to the carrier for review.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrier Actions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> The carrier can accept the RFA.</li>
                        <li><strong>Upload Revised Rates:</strong> The carrier can upload new rates if changes are required.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to the OFA, the RFA process uses indicators and colors to reflect the status of actions on the platform.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Steps to Create and Process OFA</h3>
        
            <h4>Full OFA Acceptance</h4>
            <h5>Process:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The carrier uploads the OFA (Offer for Amendment), generating a unique reference number.</li>
                <li>The shipper receives the OFA, reviews the proposed rates, and selects the "Accept All" option to approve all proposed changes.</li>
                <li>Upon clicking on "Full Amendment" Button, an amendment with a unique reference number is created for the full OFA.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Key Indicators:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepted lanes are marked with a green status indicator.</li>
                <li>The OFA status changes to "Accepted."</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Full Counter OFA Acceptance</h4>
            <h5>Process:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The carrier uploads the OFA, which generates a unique reference number.</li>
                <li>The shipper reviews the OFA and selects the "Counter All" option to propose alternate rates.</li>
                <li>The carrier reviews the shipper’s countered rates and selects "Accept All Counters" to finalize the changes.</li>
                <li>The system generates a unique reference number for the countered OFA and finalizes the amendment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Key Indicators:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Countered lanes are marked with a blue status indicator.</li>
                <li>Finalized lanes are marked with a green status indicator.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Revised OFA After Counter Rejection</h4>
            <h5>Process:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The carrier uploads the OFA, generating a unique reference number.</li>
                <li>The shipper reviews and counters the OFA with updated rates.</li>
                <li>The carrier reviews the countered OFA and selects the "Reject Counter" option for specific lanes.</li>
                <li>The carrier uploads revised rates for the rejected lanes, which the shipper reviews and accepts.</li>
                <li>Upon clicking on "Full Amendment" Button, an amendment with a unique reference number is created for the full OFA.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Key Indicators:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Rejected lanes are marked with a red status indicator.</li>
                <li>Accepted revised lanes are marked with a green status indicator.</li>
                <li>Countered lanes are marked with a blue status indicator.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Partial OFA Acceptance and Counter</h4>
            <h5>Process:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The carrier uploads the OFA, generating a unique reference number.</li>
                <li>The shipper reviews the OFA and accepts specific lanes by selecting specific lanes and clicking on "Accept" Button.</li>
                <li>The shipper counters the remaining lanes with updated rates.</li>
                <li>The system generates two amendments:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One amendment for the accepted lanes by selecting specific lanes and clicking on "Partial Amendment" Button.</li>
                        <li>Another amendment for the countered lanes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The carrier reviews and processes the countered lanes (accepts or rejects them). If the shipper accepts, the system finalizes the amendments.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Key Indicators:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepted lanes are marked with a green status indicator.</li>
                <li>Countered lanes are marked with a blue status indicator.</li>
                <li>Rejected lanes (if applicable) are marked with a red status indicator.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Partial OFA Revision After Rejection</h4>
            <h5>Process:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The carrier uploads the OFA, generating a unique reference number.</li>
                <li>The shipper reviews the OFA and accepts specific lanes by selecting specific lanes and clicking on the "Accept" Button.</li>
                <li>The shipper will have the option to create an Amendment for the accepted lanes by selecting specific lanes and clicking on the "Partial Amendment" Button.</li>
                <li>The shipper counters the remaining lanes with updated rates.</li>
                <li>The carrier reviews and rejects the countered lanes and uploads a revised OFA with updated rates.</li>
                <li>The shipper reviews the revised OFA and accepts the updated rates.</li>
                <li>If accepted, upon selecting the revised lanes and clicking on the "Partial Amendment" Button, an amendment with a unique reference number is created for the Partial OFA.</li>
                <li>The system generates amendments for both the accepted and revised lanes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Key Indicators:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Rejected lanes are marked with a red status indicator.</li>
                <li>Accepted revised lanes are marked with a green status indicator.</li>
            </ul>
